Astronomers estimate there are approximately 200 billion trillion stars, or 200 sextillion (that's a 2 followed by 23 zeros) stars in the observable universe[4]. However, this number is subject to ongoing research and different calculation methods.\\n\\nWhen astronomers attempt to calculate this figure, they typically multiply the estimated number of stars in an average galaxy by the estimated number of galaxies in the universe. The Milky Way alone is estimated to contain about 100 billion stars[1][2]. Outside our galaxy, there are millions upon millions of other galaxies also containing vast numbers of stars[2].\\n\\nMore recent and refined calculations suggest there are between 6 and 20 trillion galaxies in the observable universe[5]. However, simply multiplying the number of stars in the Milky Way by the number of galaxies would lead to an overestimation, as our galaxy is larger and more massive than average[5].\\n\\nWhen accounting for the varying sizes of galaxies and stellar death, a more accurate estimate puts the current number of stars at about 2.14 sextillion (2.14 × 10^21)[5]. This is approximately one billion stars for each of the estimated 2 trillion galaxies in our universe[5].\\n\\nIt's worth noting that star formation has changed over time. The current star-formation rate is only about 3% of its maximum, which occurred more than 10 billion years ago[5]. This means the universe had even more stars in the past, with many having completed their life cycles.\\n\\nAs our observational technologies improve and our understanding of the cosmos deepens, these estimates may continue to be refined in the future.\", refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=None, audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None), delta={'role': 'assistant', 'content': ''})], created=1746532444, model='sonar-pro', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=341, prompt_tokens=31, total_tokens=372, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None, search_context_size='low'), citations=['https://www.space.com/26078-how-many-stars-are-there.html', 'https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Herschel/How_many_stars_are_there_in_the_Universe', 'https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/', 'https://www.astronomy.com/science/astro-for-kids-how-many-stars-are-there-in-space/', 'https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/overestimated-stars-in-universe/'])\n",

      "\n",
      "looking at the first search result [1], it says william lawson's parent company is john dewar & sons, which is owned by bacardi ltd. so bacardi owns it through john dewar & sons. then in [3], it mentions that bacardi acquired martini & rossi in 1993, which included the william lawson's brand. also, [9] states that bacardi acquired martini & rossi in 1992. \n",
      "\n",
      "result [6] talks about bacardi's portfolio including william lawson's. [10] also lists william lawson's under bacardi's brands. [12] confirms that bacardi owns william lawson's. [14] mentions bacardi's acquisition of martini & rossi in 1993 brought william lawson's into their portfolio. [15] and [16] also list william lawson's as part of bacardi's brands. \n",

      "first, i need to check the provided search results for any direct mentions of ownership. looking at the sources:\n",

      "- source [7], [15], [16], [17], and [18] all refer to martini as part of bacardi limited's portfolio. specifically, [17] mentions that bacardi acquired martini & rossi in 1993, making martini part of their holdings.\n",
      "- source [10] mentions \"bacardi martini bv\" as a holding company under bacardi-martini & rossi holdings.\n",
      "\n",
      "the key points here are the merger in 1993 and the repeated references to martini being under bacardi's portfolio. the name 'bacardi martini' appears in the context of the group formed after the merger. therefore, it's confirmed that the brand martini is owned by the bacardi martini holding company.\n",

      "\n",
      "first, looking at the search results provided. search result [9] from wikipedia about bacardi mentions that bacardi acquired martini & rossi in 1993, forming the bacardi-martini group. it also lists the brands under bacardi, including \"liqueur: bénédictine, cedlila, get, martini spirito...\" so here, 'get' is listed as one of the liqueur brands under bacardi's portfolio. that directly connects 'get' to bacardi, which is part of the bacardi-martini group.\n",
      "\n",
      "another search result [5] from wikipedia's get 27 article states, \"the company is now part of casanis, owned by bacardi.\" get 27 is a mint liqueur, and casanis being owned by bacardi would mean that get brand is under bacardi's ownership. since bacardi-martini is the holding company, this further supports that 'get' is part of their portfolio.\n",

      "Réponse de Perplexity : <think>\n",
      "okay, let me tackle this query. the user is asking if the brand 'volvic' belongs to the holding company 'danone'. i need to answer with just 'oui', 'non', or 'je ne sais pas' without any explanation. \n",
      "\n",
      "first, i'll check the search results provided. result [1] mentions volvic as part of danone's portfolio. result [2] states that evian volvic suisse is a subsidiary of group danone. result [5] from wikipedia explicitly says volvic is owned by danone since 1993. result [4] refers to volvic as part of the danone group. result [6] and [8] are from danone's official websites, both listing volvic under their brands. result [7] mentions danone-owned volvic. all these sources consistently confirm that volvic is owned by danone. there's no conflicting information. therefore, the answer should be 'oui'.\n",
